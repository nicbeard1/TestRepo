### User Goals

## Design

i certainly wanted images of lego bricks on the website, although i havent got them working properly yet. i also wanted the colour scheme to be a little brighter, hence the use of Royal Blue in the header rather than Black.

### Colour Scheme

the websites colour scheme is White with a Blue header, black Text and footer. in the footer is a line of white text containing the Copyright statement. 

### Typography 

The font used that of the BootStrap theme used.

### imagery

All images were taken from the Google website and reference was provided where applicable. 

### Features

Custom Favicon of a team of original characters

### Accessibility 

i ensured that the colours contrasted and the text was of a legible size. 

## Technology

the website is made public using Github Pages

### Languages Used

 HTML and CSS were used for this project, as well as the Full Width Pics Bootstrap template.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

* GitHub Desktop - Version control.

* GitHub - To save and store the files for the website.

* Bootstrap v5.2 - a framework used for the website. Used when creating rows and columns. Also, the form element was almost entirely created using this framework, with the support of standard CSS3 code to override certain styles.

* Google Dev Tools - Troubleshooting, testing features and solving issues with responsiveness and styling.

* [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) To show the website image on a range of devices.
* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) To create favicon.

## Testing

Testing progressed at every stage of this project. This ensured that most issues were fixed before the website was finished. Chrome DevTools were utilised when building the website to help with troubleshooting as the website transformed. 

The following issues were raised during my project meeting with the client:
* issue 1
* issue 2


### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML and CSS pages.

### Fixed Bugs

TBC

#### Home page

* I began by clicking on the "home" link and the logo to see if the homepage loads correctly.
* Next, I scrolled down to see if all of the images and all content loaded correctly.
* I ensured that from the Home page - all navbar links lead to the right page.
* Lastly, I checked if the social links in the footer element work correctly as well.
* Form
  * I clicked on the "Submit" button - Error message appeared "Please fill in this field" - As expected.
  * Next, I filled in the required field (email) - The same error message should appear indicating that the "Your name" field must be completed before submitting the form.
  * The same process was repeated for the Your Email, Subject and Message fields.
  * When all fields are completed, the "Submit" button should display a "thank you" message without any errors on the form.
